# Quick-Command-Line-Mile-Tracker
This is useful lightweight tool for food delivery drivers wanting to track their miles for tax purposes. it runs through the command line and is a quick program to do so. Eventually, after learning how to write apps for mobile devices, a more updated, GUI version will be created for download.
